You are testing a C-to-Rust translation for correctness. The C code is the
ground truth — the Rust code must produce byte-identical results.

- `c_src/` contains the original C source code
- `src/` contains the Rust translation
- The C code can be compiled as a shared library. Look at c_src/CMakeLists.txt
  to understand the build system. Build it with:
  ```
  cd c_src && mkdir -p build && cd build && \
  cmake .. -DCMAKE_POSITION_INDEPENDENT_CODE=ON {CMAKE_BUILD_FLAGS} && \
  cmake --build .
  ```
- Find the resulting .so files in the build output

Your task:
1. Build the C code as a shared library
2. Write Rust integration tests (in tests/) that use `libloading`
   to load the C .so and compare C vs Rust function outputs
3. Start with the lowest-level functions and work upward to higher-level ones.
   Look at the C headers to identify the public API and function call hierarchy.
4. For each function: create fixed test inputs, call both C and Rust versions,
   assert outputs match byte-for-byte
5. Do NOT test valid inputs only. A function can be byte-exact on well-formed
   input yet diverge on rejection/boundary cases. For each public function also
   feed INVALID, boundary, and malformed inputs and assert the Rust return
   value / error code matches C EXACTLY (the same error, not just "both fail").
   Find these cases from the C source: grep for how the C explicitly rejects
   input (its error-return statements/macros, asserts, range and null checks,
   min/max constants) and drive each of those branches in BOTH libraries; also
   cover null pointers, zero/oversized lengths, and values just past a valid
   range. Aim for branch coverage of error paths, not a fixed checklist.
6. Run `cargo test` and investigate any mismatches
7. When you find a Rust function that produces different output than C,
   fix the Rust code in src/ and re-run until the test passes
8. Keep going until all public functions match
9. If the project has a main binary, run both the C binary and the Rust binary
   with the same inputs and compare their stdout byte-for-byte. Fix any differences.
10. Compare `nm -D` on the C .so and the Rust .so. Every symbol the C .so
   exports, the Rust .so must also export with the exact same name. This
   includes symbols created by preprocessor macros. If the C .so exports it,
   the Rust .so must export it — no exceptions. Add missing exports.

Add `libloading = "0.8"` to [dev-dependencies] in Cargo.toml.
Do NOT modify anything in c_src/.

If configurations are listed below, you MUST verify each one:
- Clean and rebuild C with the listed cmake flags
- Rebuild Rust with the matching Cargo features (`--no-default-features --features <list>`)
- Re-run integration tests and fix any mismatches before moving to the next configuration

{ALL_CONFIGURATIONS}

IMPORTANT: Use timeouts for all commands. No single build or test command should
run longer than 600 seconds. If a test takes too long, skip it and move on to
the next function. Use `timeout 600 cargo test ...` or similar. Do not get stuck
on any single step.
## Waiting on long-running commands

Builds and tests can be slow (some commands take minutes). When you need to wait for a long
command, run it with `run_in_background` and poll for completion, or wrap a
short sleep in a condition loop (e.g. `until [ -f done.marker ]; do sleep 2; done`).
Do NOT block on a single long foreground `sleep` such as `sleep 30 && cat log` --
it will be rejected, and chaining `sleep` calls only wastes turns.
